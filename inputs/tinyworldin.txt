Limbo~
   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all
sensation of physical matter, surrounded by swirling glowing
lights, which fade into the relative darkness around you
without any trace of edge or shadow.

The Weaponsforger~
     This blazing hot room houses the fort's Smithy.
The forge is in the center and there are several weapons and pieces of other
metal objects strewn about the floor. Sweat is dripping from the tip of your nose.
If you're not here to get a weapon forged, you should consider leaving.
Hanging off to one side is a sign.

Temple of Shima~
The Godess of lust and beauty; Shima's Temple makes your body quiver with 
warmth and longing. Through the open dome an illusion of heaven satiates 
your senses. The country of the gods, every breeze bear a different perfume. 
The robes of the immortals are dyed with liquid jewels; they shine in a 
lambent light. You stand, shaken by longing for the velvet meadows and 
aquamarine skies.

Temple of Siveni Gray-Eyes~
Lightning whips the temple's marble, scarring it black.
Screeching, a silver raven flap out from between a pair
of columns and perchs complaining in the topmost branches
of a golden-appled tree lining the entrance. At the end of
the white, marble hall is Siveni's great statue in her
aspect as Defender, seated, armed and helmed, holding her
battalion vanquishing spear in one hand and her raven
perched on the other.

statue siveni~
The great work, the statue that the artist Rahen spent five years fashioning 
of marble, gold, and ivory, afterward putting down his sculptor's tools 
forever and saying he knew his life's masterwork when he saw it, and would 
make no other.

Temple of Father Ils~
You are standing in the golden Temple of Ils, father to all Ilsigi gods. 
Vacant of furniture, except an altar of purest gold, and above it on the far 
wall, a painting. Depicted, a scarlet Sikkintair that soar above the heads 
of feasting gods, the transcendent splendor of the Face of Ils, the grace 
Eshi pouring wine, and beside her is seated Thilli, or is it Theba..

Temple of Rita Blue-Eyes~
Blue light stab your eyes. Where is the light coming from that fill the 
temple suddenly? The Temple with its white marble floors and Carronnese 
carpets and gilt furnishings; all included in a spell-circle, a spell that 
retrieves timelessness as well as time. The light of yesterday, and 
tomorrow, is available to you - through the eyes of the Godess of Purity and 
Love.

Temple of Mother Bey~
You stumble inside the wildly decorated Temple of the Fish-Eyed Beysibs and 
their sole Godess - Mother Bey. With your fall comes the light, blazing in 
through the temple's high narrow windows like the sky splitting; and the 
thundercrack, one deafening bolt that reverberate over the roofs of 
Sanctuary - breaking what glass remain unbroken in the temple's windows, and 
jolting loose what is already shattered, raining it all down on the greenish 
marble floor in a storm of razory chimings. Then stillness again.

Temple of Novak~
In the blinding light inside the Temple of the departed God Novak, you can 
barely see the book you read from, the stone walls around you; they seem 
ephemeral as things dream. You set to work; drawing a complex diagram, 
seemingly a picture of some kind of geometrical solid, though one in which 
the number of sides seem to change each time one counts them. The finished 
diagram makes an uneasy flickering in the mind, a feeling that get worse as 
you start setting the necessary runes and words into the pattern's angles. 
'The Upraising of the Lost, that is to say, an infallible spell for finding 
the lost and strayed and stolen..'

Hall of Mirrors~
  You see many reflections of yourself in many strange mirrors,
some make you fat some make you about 3 inches tall. You feel
a little disoriented making the exit hard to find.
